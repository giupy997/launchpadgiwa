# HOLO Launchpad

Pump.fun-style launchpad for launching tokens on EVM chains. Primary target:
**GIWA** (Upbit/Dunamu's OP Stack L2), with a chain-agnostic architecture for
future multichain deployments (Monad, MegaETH, ...).

## Structure

- `contracts/` — smart contracts (Solidity + Foundry)
  - `src/Launchpad.sol` — factory + bonding curve (constant product with
    virtual reserves), protocol fees, graduation and DEX migration
  - `src/LaunchToken.sol` — ERC-20 created by the launchpad; transfers locked
    until graduation
  - `src/interfaces/IDexMigrator.sol` — pluggable DEX adapter (one per chain)
- `web/` — Next.js 14 + wagmi v2 + viem frontend
  - Home: token creation and on-chain token list (multicall, 5s refresh)
  - `/token/[address]`: curve stats, progress bar, buy/sell box with
    on-chain quotes, automatic approve and 1% slippage guard

## Curve parameters

- Total supply: 1B per token; 800M sold on the curve, 200M reserved for DEX
- Virtual reserves: 1.25 ETH / 1.05B tokens → the curve raises ~4 ETH
- Fee: 1% on buys and sells (max 5%, owner-configurable)
- Graduation: once the 800M are sold out → curve trading closes,
  `migrate()` moves 200M tokens + raised ETH to the DEX adapter

## Commands

```bash
cd contracts
forge test                       # test suite (17 tests, incl. fuzz)
```

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # frontend at http://localhost:3000
```

Deploy to GIWA Sepolia (requires `.env` with `PRIVATE_KEY`, see `.env.example`):

```bash
cd contracts && source .env && forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url giwa_sepolia --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" --broadcast
```

## TODO

- [x] Deploy to GIWA Sepolia (Jul 27, 2026) and read-only smoke test
- [x] On-chain smoke test: test token [`TEST` 0x7Fc8...1305](https://sepolia-explorer.giwa.io/address/0x7Fc8d6f3AD8b93F771Cd0Dadd458A495c42F1305) created with initial buy, curve and pricing verified
- [x] Next.js + wagmi frontend (create, list, buy, sell)
- [x] Source verification on Blockscout (Launchpad and TEST token)
- [ ] `IDexMigrator` adapter for a DEX on GIWA (to pick once the mainnet
      ecosystem is live)
- [ ] Event indexer (creations, trades) for feed, rankings and price chart
- [ ] End-to-end frontend test with a wallet (MetaMask) on GIWA Sepolia
- [ ] Verify permissionless deploy policy on GIWA mainnet
- [ ] Legal review (MiCA) before public launch
